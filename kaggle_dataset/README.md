About Dataset
This dataset contains time series data generated by a damped harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has a mass of 1 kg, a spring constant of 1 N/m, and a damping coefficient of 0.1 Ns/m. The oscillator is initially displaced by 1 meter and given an initial velocity of 0. The time series data includes the displacement, velocity, acceleration, and power of the oscillator over time.

Note that this is a constrained dataset: the energy is decreasing through time; the rate of dissipation of energy is the same through time.

The equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is given by a 2nd order ODE
$$
    m \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + c \frac{d x}{d t} + kx = 0
$$
where m is the mass of the oscillator, c is the damping coefficient, k is the spring constant, x is the displacement of the oscillator from its equilibrium position, and t is time.

The goal is to predict the evolution of the variables of the system through time. There are data available to evaluate the adjusted model at 3 tasks:
-reconstruction: evaluate the performance at predicting the same time steps used for training;
-extrapolation: evaluate the performance at predicting for a longer time horizon than the one used for training;
-completion: evaluate the performance at predicting different sampled time steps in the same interval as the training.
